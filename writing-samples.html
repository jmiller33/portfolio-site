                    As a part of a document design course, I was tasked with writing an article relating to student life on
                    my university's campus. We were told to interview other students as a part of this process. As an off-campus and transfer student,
                    I wanted to find out how other students with similar experiences were dealing with changes caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
                    After we submitted our assignments, my professor requested that I submit my article for publication in our campus' Professional Writing magazine, <i>Memorandum</i>.

                    In my capstone English course, Business Writing, we spent the entire semester researching a business related problem,
                    coming up with a solution, and writing about it. For my research project, I used a real business and wrote about the problems
                    surrounding telecommuting. I created a survey to send to employees of this company who I know personally, as well as found outside
                    research on the topic. In the end, I wrote this letter/research report to be sent to the COO of the company, whose name has been changed for privacy.

                    One of the more difficult aspects of professional writing is communicating instructions clearly and concisely.
                    In one of my business writing courses we practiced this skill by creating a set of instructions explaining how to sign up for an
                    appointment with the University Writing Center. Then, we were instructed to practice our document design skills by turning those instructions
                    into a visually pleasing documents for students to reference.

                    Another aspect of professional writing and communication that I frequently practiced in my studies was the art of doing a presentation
                    for a professional audience. In my business writign course, we were instructed to present on a career path within the field of professional 
                    writing that we found interesting. As one aspect of this presentation assignment, we were told to write and design a handout for the audience to reference
                    to help them follow along in the presentation.

                <div class="description">
                    As an English major, I wrote many academic essays alongside all of the professional or business writing that I did. This is just one of those essays,
                    specifically a literary analysis essay on one of my favorite books that I read throughout my time in college, Sutton Griggs' <i>Imperium in Imperio</i>.
                    I wanted to share it as just another example of the range of writing skills that I possess.
